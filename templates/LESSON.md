## Template Notes

### Lesson Type Guidelines

**BUGFIX Lessons** (Beginner, 5-10 mins):
- Use: Scenario, Expected/Actual, Your Task, Sample Prompt, Expected Fix
- Focus on single concept
- Provide multiple solution options when applicable
- Keep code examples minimal

**FEATURE/ENHANCEMENT Lessons** (Intermediate, 20-30 mins):
- Use: Current State, What You'll Build, Multi-part structure
- Each part has Sample Prompt and Expected Output
- Include Testing Checklist
- Show complete code examples

**GREENFIELD/PROJECT Lessons** (30-60 mins):
- Use: Overview, Problem Statement, Key Components, Recommended Approach
- Break down into logical steps
- Include data structures
- Provide simple implementation prompt
- Focus on understanding the big picture

### Formatting Guidelines

1. **Code blocks**: Always specify language (javascript, typescript, bash, etc.)
2. **Checklists**: Use `- [ ]` for unchecked items
3. **Time estimates**: Be realistic (test yourself first)
4. **Prompts**: Write as if speaking directly to AI assistant
5. **Comments**: Use inline comments in code to explain key concepts
6. **Next steps**: Always link to the next lesson in the sequence

### Optional Sections

Include based on lesson complexity:
- Key Learning Points (always include for intermediate+)
- Common Pitfalls (include when there are known gotchas)
- Production Considerations (advanced topics beyond lesson scope)
- Before & After Comparison (refactoring lessons)
- When to Apply (pattern/architecture lessons)

### Writing Style

- Use active voice ("Create a function" not "A function should be created")
- Be specific ("Password must be 8+ characters" not "Password should be long enough")
- Show don't tell (code examples over lengthy explanations)
- Think incremental (build up complexity gradually)
