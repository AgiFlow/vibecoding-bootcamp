## Template Usage Notes

**Remove this section when creating actual chapters.**

### Structural Guidelines:
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for chapter, H2 for major sections, H3 for lessons/subsections)
- Include checkmarks (✅) for completed lessons, remove for TBD lessons
- Keep lesson time estimates realistic (5-10 min for quick fixes, 30 min for features, 60-90 min for projects)
- Use difficulty levels consistently: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced

### Content Guidelines:
- Start with a clear, specific chapter title (e.g., "Bug Fixes", "Feature Enhancements", "Greenfield Projects")
- Opening description should be one compelling sentence
- Overview should explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Lessons should link to actual markdown files in ./lessons/ directory
- Use parallel structure in lesson descriptions (all start with verbs, or all are noun phrases)

### Optional Sections:
Include these based on chapter type:
- **Learning Path**: Always include for multi-lesson chapters
- **What This Chapter Covers**: Include for comprehensive overview
- **Key Principles/Process**: Include for skill-based chapters (debugging, testing, etc.)
- **Common Patterns**: Include for chapters teaching repeatable workflows
- **Success Criteria**: Include for project-based chapters with specific outcomes
- **Backlog Lessons**: Include when planning future content
- **Reference Material**: Include if there are supporting conceptual documents

### Lesson Metadata Format:
Choose the appropriate metadata label based on chapter type:
- **What You'll Fix**: For bug/debugging chapters
- **What You'll Learn**: For concept/skill chapters
- **What You'll Build**: For project/feature chapters
- **Bug Type/Feature Type**: Additional categorization as needed

### Consistency Checklist:
- [ ] Chapter number and title match directory name
- [ ] All lesson links point to actual files
- [ ] Time estimates are present for all lessons
- [ ] Difficulty levels are assigned
- [ ] Learning path explains the recommended order
- [ ] Tips are actionable and specific
- [ ] Next chapter reference is accurate
