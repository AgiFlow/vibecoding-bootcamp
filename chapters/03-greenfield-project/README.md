# Chapter 3: Greenfield Projects

Learn how to build complete applications from scratch using AI coding assistants.

## Overview

This chapter teaches you how to create new projects from the ground up, covering authentication, APIs, data modeling, routing, and frontend development. You'll learn to architect and build production-ready applications.

The main lesson is a comprehensive project that takes you through building a complete leave request system from scratch.

## Quick Start Lessons

### [Lesson 1: Leave Request System](./lessons/01-leave-request-system.md) ✅
Build a complete leave request dashboard from scratch covering all fundamentals.

**What You'll Build:**
- Authentication (login/logout)
- Protected routes
- API endpoints (GET/POST)
- Database schema
- Dashboard page with data table
- Form for submitting requests
- Loading and error states

**Time:** 2-3 hours (comprehensive project)
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

**Key Components:**
1. **Authentication** - Login page, session management, route protection
2. **API** - GET/POST endpoints for leave requests
3. **Database** - User and leave request tables
4. **Dashboard** - Display leave requests, create new ones
5. **Routing** - Multiple pages with navigation

---

## Learning Path

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Complete **Chapter 1** (Bug Fixes) first - Build debugging skills
2. Complete **Chapter 2** (Feature Enhancements) - Learn enhancement patterns
3. Then tackle **Chapter 3** (Greenfield) - Build complete apps

**This Lesson:**
Start with Lesson 1 to build a complete system covering all the fundamentals. This is a comprehensive project that brings together everything from Chapters 1 and 2.

## What This Chapter Covers

### Full-Stack Development
- Frontend (Next.js React components)
- Backend (API routes)
- Database (schema, migrations)
- Authentication & authorization

### Application Architecture
- Project structure
- File organization
- Component hierarchy
- Data flow

### Core Features
- User authentication
- CRUD operations
- Form handling
- Data validation
- Error handling
- Loading states

---

## Project-Based Learning

Unlike Chapters 1 and 2 which have multiple short lessons, Chapter 3 focuses on building a complete, working application. This approach:

- **Simulates Real Projects** - You'll build something end-to-end
- **Integrates All Skills** - Combines auth, DB, API, UI, routing
- **Produces Working Software** - Not just isolated examples
- **Shows Best Practices** - See how pieces fit together

---

## Success Criteria

After completing the leave request system, you should be able to:
- [ ] Set up authentication from scratch
- [ ] Design database schemas
- [ ] Create RESTful API endpoints
- [ ] Build protected routes
- [ ] Handle form submissions
- [ ] Display data from APIs
- [ ] Manage loading and error states
- [ ] Structure a full-stack application

---

## Backlog Lessons (TBD)

### Lesson 2: Deployment & DevOps
**Status:** TBD - Deploying to Vercel/AWS, environment variables, CI/CD

### Lesson 3: Documentation
**Status:** TBD - README, API docs, code comments, user guides

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Follow the Steps** - The lesson breaks down the project into manageable phases
2. **Test as You Go** - Verify each component works before moving to the next
3. **Use AI Prompts** - The lesson provides sample prompts for each phase
4. **Understand the Flow** - Focus on how authentication → API → UI connect
5. **Keep It Simple** - Don't over-engineer on first pass

---

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter:
- Extend the leave request system with additional features
- Deploy it to production (see Lesson 2 when available)
- Add the backlog features (admin panel, email notifications, etc.)
- Apply these lessons to your own greenfield projects
